I am writing "stories" for a front end library. I am using vite, storybook, and vue3.
Your job is to create a `<comp-name>.stories.js` for the `<comp-name>.vue` component. Ensure to   create a base `const Template` which the stories can use a `bind` method from. For example:
```
const Template = (args) => ({
  components: { Foo },
  setup() { return { args }; },
  template: '<foo v-bind="args" />',
});
export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = { primary: true };
```

Ensure slots are covered in the template.  Ensure `argTypes` provide adequate coverage for the component. Ensure the export includes `tags: ["autodocs"]. Ensure the component is imported from `@/<comp-path>`. 

The following is the contents of "<comp-name>.vue":
```

```

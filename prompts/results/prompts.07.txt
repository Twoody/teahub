I am writing "stories" for a front end library. I am using vite, storybook, and vue3.
Your job is to create a `MyFilter.stories.js` for the `MyFilter.vue` component. Ensure to   create a base `const Template` which the stories can use a `bind` method from. For example:
```
const Template = (args) => ({
  components: { Foo },
  setup() { return { args }; },
  template: '<foo v-bind="args" />',
});
export const Primary = Template.bind({});
Primary.args = { primary: true };
```

Ensure slots are covered in the template.  Ensure `argTypes` provide adequate coverage for the component. Ensure the export includes `tags: ["autodocs"]. Ensure the component is imported from `@/components//buttons/filters/MyFilter.vue`. 
Ensure that the following import is mentioned: `import "@/assets/styles/styles.less"`.

The following is the contents of "MyFilter.vue":
```
<template>
  <MyButton
    :active="!inactive"
    class="my-filter-wrapper"
    :inactive="inactive"
    pill
  >
    <slot/>
  </MyButton>
</template>

<script>
import MyButton from "components/buttons/MyButton.vue"

export default {
  name: "MyFilter",
  components:
  {
    MyButton,
  },
  props: {
    /** Is current filter being applied */
    inactive: Boolean,
  },
}
</script>
```
